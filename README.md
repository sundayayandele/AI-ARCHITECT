# AI-ARCHITECT

A collection of **AI Solution Architecture learning materials** and **reference artifacts** (slides, PDFs, and Word docs) to support training, workshops, and self-study on building real-world AI systems—from fundamentals (supervised learning) to end-to-end AI stack architecture.

> This repo is primarily **documentation & slideware** (not a software project). Use it as a knowledge base and presentation pack.
